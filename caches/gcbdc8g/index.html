  <p style="font-size:125%;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:8px">The Seven Bridges
    of Königsberg</p>

  <p>
    Leonhard Euler (pronounced <em>oiler</em>; 1707 &ndash; 1783) is considered
    by many people
    (include myself) to be the greatest mathematician of all time. One of the
    most significant problems that he solved is called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">The
      Seven Bridges of Königsberg</a>.
    Königsberg (now called Kaliningrad, in what is now Russia) was a city with
    seven bridges that spanned the Pregel River, connecting the two banks as
    well as two islands within the river. Denizens of the city wondered if it
    was possible to devise a walk that would cross each bridge exactly once.
  </p>

  <p>
    Euler proved that no such walk was possible. He abstracted away the physical
    details of the problem, such as the length of the bridges, by representing
    each land mass as a single <em>node</em> and each bridge as an
    <em>edge</em>. An edge serves only to represent a connection
    between two nodes. With this representation, the mathmatical field of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a> was
    born.

      <figcaption><em>Königsberg as a graph</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  <p>
    Next, Euler modelled a walk across the bridges of Königsberg as a path
    made up of the nodes, always following an edge to get from
    one node to the next. Euler observed that whenever a walk entered a
    node via an edge, it must also leave that node via a different edge (except
    for the start and end nodes). This means that the edges must come in
    pairs. That is, for all nodes except the start and end, there must be an
    even number of edges attached to it. Because each of the four nodes in
    Königsberg have an odd number of edges, no such walk is possible. Such a
    tour that visits each edge of a graph exactly once is called an <em>Eulerian
      path</em>.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:125%;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:8px">Graphs</p>

  <p>
    Mathematically speaking, a graph is a set of objects, represented as nodes
    (also called vertices), where some pairs of objects are related in some
    sense. These relations are represented as edges between the nodes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Graphs are used to represent things in the real world. Mapping and
    route-finding software represents roads as edges that connect intersections.
    Social scientists study the <em>friend graph</em> of social networks, both
    in real life and on sites like Facebook, where nodes are people and edges
    represent friendships.
  </p>

  <p>
    The graph of Königsberg is unusual in that some nodes have multiple edges
    between them. Such a graph is called a <em>multigraph</em>. Most graph
    theory, and the rest of this description, instead focuses on <em>simple
      graphs</em>, which have at most one edge between any two nodes.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:125%;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:8px">Hamiltonian paths
  </p>

  <p>
    Recall than an Eulerian path is a path that visits each edge exactly once,
    and there is a simple test for whether a graph has an Euliean path: at most
    two nodes have an odd number of edges coming out of them. What about a path
    that visits every <em>node</em> at least once? This is called a
    <em>Hamiltonian
      path</em>, after William Rowan Hamilton, who invented a game that involves
    finding a Hamiltonian path on the edges of a dodecahedron.

    Unlike an Eulerian path,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path_problem">determining

  <p style="font-size:125%;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:8px">Graph
    representation</p>

  <p>
    In computing, there are several ways to represent a graph. In this puzzle
    we will use the
    <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix">adjacency
        matrix</a></em>. The adjacency matrix of a graph with <em>n</em> nodes
    is the <em>n*n</em> matrix that has a 1 in position (<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>)
    if there is an edge between node <em>i</em> and node <em>j</em>,
    otherwise it has a 0.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consider the following graph with five nodes:

  <p>
    There are two things to notice about this matrix:

  <ol>
    <li>
      It is symmetric. This is because the graph is <em>undirected</em>. That
      is, edges can be traversed in either direction. In some graphs, edges can
      be <em>directed</em>, meaning they point in a single direction. The
      adjacency matrix of a directed graphs is not necessarily symmetric.
    </li>
    <li>
      The entries along the main diagonal are all 0. This is because there are
      no
      edges that connect a node to itself.
    </li>
  </ol>
  </p>
-->

  <p style="font-size:125%;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:8px">Weighted graphs
  </p>

  <p>
    It is possible to extend the utlity of a graph further by incorporating
    the notion of a cost to traversing an edge. Graphs whose edges have such
    costs, or weights, are called <em>weighted graphs</em>. Weighted graphs
    allow more realistic representation of things in the natural world, such a
    roads and flight paths. On a graph that represents cities as nodes and
    highways as edges, one natural weight of an edge would be the distance of
    that highway.
  </p>

  <p>
    To represent a weighted graph, cells of the adjacency matrix contain the
    weight of that edge, rather than just a 0 or 1. Here is an example of such a
    matrix:
