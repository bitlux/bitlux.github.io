  <p style="font-size:125%;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:8px">The Seven Bridges
    of Königsberg</p>

  <p>
    Leonhard Euler (pronounced <em>oiler</em>) is considered by many people
    (include myself) to be the greatest mathematician of all time. One of the
    most significant problems that he solved was called
    <em><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">The
        Seven Bridges of Königsberg</a></em>.
    Königsberg (now called Kaliningrad, in what is now Russia) was a city with
    seven bridges that spanned the Pregel River, connecting the two banks as
    well as two islands within the river. Denizens of the city wondered if it
    was possible to devise a walk that would cross each bridge exactly once.
  </p>

  <p>
    Euler proved that no such walk was possible. He abstracted away the physical
    details of the problem, such as the length of the bridges, by representing
    each land mass as a single <em>node</em> and each bridge as an
    <em>edge</em>. An edge serves only to represent a connection
    between two nodes. With this representation, the mathmatical field of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a> was
    born.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, Euler modelled a walk across the bridges of Königsberg as a path
    consisting of the various nodes, always following an edge to get from
    one node to the next. Euler observed that whenever a walk entered a
    node via an edge, it must also leave that node via a different edge (except
    for the start and end nodes). This means that the edges must come in
    pairs. That is, for all nodes except the start and end, there must be an
    even number of edges attached to it. Because each of the four nodes in
    Königsberg have an odd number of edges, no such walk is possible. Such a
    tour that visits each edge of a graph exactly once is called an <em>Eulerian
      tour</em> or <em>Eulerian path</em>.

  <p style="font-size:125%;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:8px">Graphs and
    representations</p>

  <p>
    Mathematically speaking, a graph is a set of objects, represented as nodes
    (also called vertices), where some pairs of objects are related in some
    sense. These relations are represented as edges between the nodes. A graph
    is defined by its set of nodes and set of edges.
  </p>

  <p>
    Graphs are often representations of networks in the real world. Mapping and
    route-finding software represents roads as edges that connect intersections.
    Social scientists study the <em>friend graph</em> of social networks, both
    in real life and on sites like Facebook, where nodes are people and edges
    represent friendships.
  </p>

  <p>
    The graph of Königsberg is a generalized type of graph called a
    <em>multigraph</em>, because it has multiple connections between some nodes.
    The rest of this desctiption will focus on <em>simple graphs</em>, which
    have at most one edge between any two nodes.
  </p>

  <p>
    In computing, there are several ways to represent a graph. In this puzzle
    we will use the
    <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix">adjacency
        matrix</a></em>. The adjacency matrix of a graph with <em>n</em> nodes
    is the <em>n*n</em> binary matrix that has a 1 in position (<em>i</em>,
    <em>j</em>) if there is an edge between node <em>i</em> and node <em>j</em>,
    otherwise it has a 0.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consider the following graph with five nodes:
    <img style="display:block;margin:auto" src="abcde.png"><br />
    The adjacency matrix for this graph is this:
  </p>

  <table style="margin:auto;border-collapse:collapse;font-size: 20px">
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>B</td>
      <td>C</td>
      <td>D</td>
      <td>E</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>B</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>C</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>D</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>E</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    There are two thigns to notice about this matrix:
    It is symmetric. This is because the graph is undirected.

    The entries along the main diagonal are all 0. This is because there are no
    edges that connect a node to itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is possible to extend our definition of a graph further, by incorporating
    a notion of cost to traversing an edge.
    One can imaging that in a //// mapping software, further distance btween
    cities
