### My journey

#### 2015

I happened to find the original California CAA cache in my first week of
caching. It was located very close to my work at the time. I had no idea what
CAA was. My log was simply "TFTC". Such a neophyte.

#### 2024

I first heard about the CAA series from
[this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/1g3tla6/mustcache_in_washington_dc_area/),
which listed the series final as a must-do cache in DC. I already had a goal of
finding a cache in every state, but this added an irresistible layer of
difficulty, and a sense of organized curation, to it. I knew I had to get my
name in the hall of fame.

The replacement California cache was fortunately in the Bay Area. I made the
short drive and found the cache in a beautiful park with spectacular views of
the coast. A great way to start the series. I did a long loop with a brutal
uphill climb on the way back. Near the paring lot, there was a medical
emergency on the trail, and I actually saw a very rugged ambulance drive on
the trail to transport the victim away.

For Christmas, my family visited my sister in New York City. I knew I wouldn't
have much time to make a long trip, and I didn't have a car of my own, so I
only made one CAA attempt: New Jersey, which is actually the closest CAA cache
to NYC. I made the 2.5 hour (one-way) drive in the dark, but other than some
self-induced GPS problems, I had no issues finding the cache--even though the
only light I had during the search was my phone's flashlight.
