### My journey

#### 2015

I happened to find the original California CAA cache in my first week of caching. It was located very close to my work at the time. I had no idea what CAA was. My log was simply "TFTC". Such a neophyte.

#### 2024

I first heard about the CAA series from [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/1g3tla6/mustcache_in_washington_dc_area/), which listed the series final as a must-do cache in DC. I already had a goal of finding a cache in every state, but this added an irresistible layer of difficulty, and a sense of organized curation, to it. I knew I had to get my name in the hall of fame.
